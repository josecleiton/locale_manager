# locale_manager

The LocaleManagerPlugin is a Flutter plugin that allows you to update the native language setting of the app for both iOS and Android. This can be useful when you want to dynamically change the appâ€™s language.


## Usage
 
To use this plugin, add `locale_manager` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.io/platform-plugins/).

```yaml

dependencies:
	locale_manager: any

```

### Available Methods

- `setLocale`: Sets the native language of the app. Parameter: locale (String) - the language code to set (e.g., en-US, pt-BR). 
- `getLocale`: Returns the current language of the app.
- `getLocalized`: Returns the localized string for a specific key.

## Example

## Limitations

The iOS plugin updates the View only if the specified language is supported by the app. If the language is not supported, the app will continue to use the previous language until restart.
